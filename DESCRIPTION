Title: A Suite of Packages for Analysis of Big Genomic Data
Description: Modern genomic datasets are big (large n), high-dimensional
    (large p), and multi-layered. The challenges that need to be addressed are
    memory requirements and computational demands. Our goal is to develop
    software that will enable researchers to carry out analyses with big
    genomic data within the R environment. The BGData package is an umbrella
    package that comprises several packages: BEDMatrix, LinkedMatrix, and
    symDMatrix. It features scalable and efficient computational methods for
    large genomic datasets such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or
    genomic relationship matrices (G matrix). It also contains a data
    structure called BGData that holds genotypes in the @geno slot, phenotypes
    in the @pheno slot, and additional information in the @map slot.
