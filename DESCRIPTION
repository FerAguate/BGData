Title: Memory Mapped Matrices and Data Structures for Genomic Data
Description: Genetic data can be very large and often holding data in RAM is not
    feasible. In a Memory Mapped File the actual data is stored on the HD. The ff R
    package implements memory mapped arrays and provides a very fast implementation
    of indexing operations, this allows accessing cells of the array almost at the
    same speed as accessing those cells in a regular matrix object (held in RAM).
    However, with ff the array size is limited by the largest integer supported by
    the system; with genomic data we often exceed this. Therefore we are developing
    new classes (RowLinkedMatrix and ColumnLinkedMatrix) which are essentially
    collections of ff objects. In these classes we distribute a matrix either by
    rows (RowLinkedMatrix) or columns (ColumnLinkedMatrix) into multiple ff objects.
    We have developed indexing and many other methods that allows the user to
    deal with these objects as if they were regular matrices. In addition we have
    developed methods that can take RowLinkedMatrix or ColumnLinkedMatrix as input
    to compute genomic relationship matrices, etc. The classes ColumnLinkedMatrix
    and RowLinkedMatrix were designed to hold genotype data (integer coding), the
    class BGData contains three slots @geno, @map and @pheno and can be used to hold
    GWAS data.
